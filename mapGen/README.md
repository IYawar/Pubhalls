# How to Use
By default, you can use WASD and/or arrow keys to move around. 

If you wish to use mobile, you can enable the d-pad feature by clicking on the settings (gears) button, and enabling the feature. The d-pad can be moved around by dragging the center, and will make sure to always be visible when re-orienting the page.

Take a look around settings to see what else you can do! A help menu will be added (eventually), to describe each option in more detail.

# Issues
If you have any issues, requests, or recommendations feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/husky-rotmg/MapReadingPractice-Web/issues)! I'm using this as a sort of request/task board, so you can see what changes I plan on doing or attempting to do.
