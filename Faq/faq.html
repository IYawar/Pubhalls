            <h2 class="headline">Welcome to the Pub Halls FAQ.</h2>
            <h2 class="headline">Here we will answer some commonly asked questions our mod team receives, for your convenience.</h2>
            <h2 class="below">Each section is separated by a header below to help find the answers you are looking for.</h2>
            <h2><span>VERIFYING</span></h2> <!--This will act as the image for the headliners.-->>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I get verified?</h3>
            <p>Head over to <a class="dn" href="https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/343711922417434634" target="_blank">#how-to-verify</a> in our discord server and follow the instructions there.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I know if I am verified?</h3>
            <p>You will receive a message from the bot letting you know that you have been verified, and you will also have a purple name and access to the raiding section.
            </p>
            <h3 class="underline">I just got verified, but none of the channels are loading messages. What should I do?</h3>
            <p>Message an Officer or above explaining the situation, and ask them to remove and re-add your role. Once they do that, you should be good to go</p>
            <h3 class="underline">Why am I expelled/on blacklist while trying to verify?</h3>
            <p class="spaceforheader">You are expelled because a verifier deemed your account to be an potential alt account. If you think this was a mistake, contact a Security or above so that they may direct you to the person who expelled you. You may talk it out with them.</p>
            <!--Raiding section-->
            <h2><span>RAIDING</span></h2>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I join a Lost Halls run?</h3>
            <p>First, head over to <a class="dn" href="https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/379779029479194624" target="_blank">#raid-status-announcements</a> in the discord server and wait for an AFK check to begin. Once an AFK check begins, look for which channel the raid will be taking place in, which will be presented at the top of the embedded message the bot sends. Next, join the appropriate voice channel once it unlocks. Channels can fill fast due to the cap, so be quick.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I pop a key for the server?</h3>
            <p>In order to pop a key for the server, react to the <img src="../images/lhkey.png" alt="lhkey" class="icon"> emote. Make sure to be quick to react to the emote. After doing this, you will receive a message from the bot asking you to confirm that you have a key by reacting with the ✅. After confirming with the bot, you will receive the raid location. Head to that location and trade the Raid Leader with the key in your inventory so that they may confirm that there is indeed a key. Next, wait for the Raid Leader to tell your to pop the key, after which, you should pop the key.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I pop a vial for the server?</h3>
            <p>In order to pop a vial for the server, react to the <img src="../images/vial.png" class="icon"> emote. Make sure to be quick to react to the emote. After doing this, you will receive a dm from the bot asking you to confirm that you have a vial by reacting with the ✅ . After confirming with the bot, you will receive the raid location and a message telling you which vial you are, main, backup, or backup two. Head to that location and trade the Raid Leader with the vial in your inventory so that they may confirm that there is indeed a vial. Next, wait for the Raid Leader to tell your to pop the vial, after which, you should pop the vial. Do not pop the vial right away. If you are not designated main vial, wait for the raid leader to call for backup vial or backup backup to pop.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">Why was I moved out of the raiding channel?</h3>
            <p>You may experiencing a known android bug, which disconnects users on Android when channel permissions change. If you were in the channel when the AFK check ended, message the bot that started the AFK check `join` or click `Reconnect` on the AFK check panel to be moved back in. If the bot says you were not apart of any runs, you should leave the run promptly to avoid getting suspended. Use Desktop Discord if possible to avoid glitches.</p>
            <p class="some-space">If you were kicked out of the raiding channel immediately after joining, it was most likely a bug on Discord's end.  When a new raiding channel opens up, raiders will all try to join at the same time and it'll appear as if you joined on your client; however, it won't appear so on Discord's servers. To remedy this, the server will kick you out of the call. Essentially, it's a network issue and there's nothing we can do in that situation.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">What is the location of the run?</h3>
            <p>The location is hidden from raiders until both the afk check and the Raid Leader’s countdown have ended, after which the Raid Leader will call out location in the voice call. Make sure you are ready to go and waiting at your server selection screen before the countdown ends.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">Do I have to talk in the voice channel?</h3>
            <p>No, only staff members are unmuted in raiding channels to allow effective communication and ensure the safety of the raiders.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">Why won't the Raid Leader move me in?</h3>
            <p class="spaceforheader">Raid leaders are not allowed to move raiders into the voice channel unless absolutely necessary in order to ensure the HP scaling of the dungeon stays at a reasonable and achievable limit. If you missed the run, wait for another to start.</p>
            <!--Suspensions section.-->
            <h2><span class="sus">SUSPENSIONS</span></h2>
            <h3 class="underline">Why was I suspended?</h3>
            <p>You were suspended because a staff member believed you were breaking a rule. You can find who suspended you by looking in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/384237088033341443" target="_blank" class="dn">#suspend-log</a>, and you may dispute your suspension by contacting the person who issued the suspension.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">I have been permanently suspended for being in a blacklisted guild. How do I appeal?</h3>
            <p class="spaceforheader">Once you have left the guild, contact a Security or above and provide a screenshot of your guild history on <a class="dn" href="realmeye.com" target="_blank">Realmeye</a> proving you have left the blacklisted guild. Some members who were worse offenders may not be unsuspended, so make sure you're following the rules.</p>
            <!--Misc section.-->
            <h2><span>Misc.</span></h2>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I add an alt account to my name on Discord?</h3>
            <p>In order to add an alt account to your name, message a Security or above a screenshot of you on the alt account in your vault saying your discord tag (for example: bob#1234) in the chat. They will take care of the rest.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I become a Raid Leader?</h3>
            <p>Application openings will be announced in <a class="dn" href="https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/433117430588375040" target="_blank">#verified-announcements</a>, you may apply to become a raid leader through the google sheet that gets posted with the announcement.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">How do I reduce lag in the raids?</h3>
            <p>In the game settings you can set your opacity lower, turn off friendly shots and more to help reduce lag in the Halls and other areas of the game.</p>
            <h3 class="underline">What is the invite link?</h3>
            <p><a class="dn" href="discord.gg/losthalls" target="_blank">discord.gg/losthalls</a></p>
            <h3 class="underline">What perks do Nitro Boosters get?</h3>

Boosters also receive a guaranteed spot in a vc once per hour when they react with   <img src="../images/Nitro.png" alt="Nitro" class="nitro"> on an AFK check. You must still arrive at the location with everyone else, this perk does <span class="bold">NOT</span> include early location. Limit 5 per run.</p>
